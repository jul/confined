The name of this design is confined. For this part I use all the moral rights
given by the bern/geneva convention to make sure my incessible moral rights are enforced
on the topic of the conceptual integrity. I am the only person on earth that can
call this stuff «confined» and only patches I reviewed or made are ok.
Any use of this terms and code with the claims its confined with substancial 
modifications according to the latest release breaking the confinment is a fraud and 
violates my moral right on the concept. As such I hereby tell you that I will be even 
worse than Poutin with the ukranians if you dare me.

You can check with your legal department.

When available the core specifications will have to be enforced for any derived works
to claim the name.

And I hereby state that I will not let the eval function/call stack be infinite.
For now it is one, and it is fine with me.

The purpose of this is to make sure performance and memory use are confined
and user interactions have NO way to do system calls.

It is by design that the final version will FORCE you to state the max size of the stack,
the max size of the script that can be inputed.
